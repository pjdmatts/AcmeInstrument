## README

- A README with instructions is included with the project
- The README indicates which project is chosen.
- The README includes information about each rubric point addressed.

## Compiling and Testing 

- The submission must compile and run.

## Loops, Functions, I/O

- The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.
- The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file.
- The project accepts user input and processes the input.

## Object Oriented Programming

- The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.
- Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
- Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.
- Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.
- Classes encapsulate behavior.
- Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy.
- Overloaded functions allow the same function to operate on different parameters.
- Derived class functions override virtual base class functions.
- Templates generalize functions in the project.

## Memory Management

- The project makes use of references in function declarations.
- The project uses destructors appropriately.
- The project uses scope / Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) where appropriate.
- The project follows the Rule of 5.
- The project uses move semantics to move data, instead of copying it, where possible.
- The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.

## Concurrency

- The project uses multithreading.
- A promise and future is used in the project.
- A mutex or lock is used in the project.
- A condition variable is used in the project.
